Dating as a form of social interaction in the society has evolved with the advent of the internet. While traditional and more popular dating apps like Tinder, OkCupid, and others(under the umbrella of the Match Group) aim to match two souls with a quick swipe yet there lies a lot improvements for the current era. Firstly, in such apps we need to constantly look for our partner within a distance, making it more time consuming and there might be situations where people may relocate to any professional or personal reasons, thereby restarting the whole process for the other party once again. Secondly, we are rarely given an opportunity to compare and express our likelihood to interact with potential partners quantitatively- it's usually a " Yes or No" but not " I would love to spend time with X but more with Y". Thirdly, at times one might be matched with someone yet have stronger feelings to be matched with someone else and have a gut feeling that the third person may also reciprocate back, leading to issues of cheating and adultery. So our app achieves to provide a service that lies at the intersection of the possible solution to these problems. We make use of a modified version of the famous Gayle Shapely Algorithm under the hood!. At a birds' eye view, the dating feature is localized to groups like meetups (which are linked with some additional social interaction, say Easter celebration at Park Street ). One can join a particular group, view the profiles of the other participants (seeing more than just a tagline and 4 photos), rate them on a scale of 1-10, and repeat the same. To avoid the boring process rating for all participants(of preferred gender),  we provide a base rating to everyone for the algorithm to decide. In the end, if one is honest about their relative rating of their partners our algorithm, matches them with their best possible partner and even if they have stronger affections for a second partner they would not reciprocate back.
